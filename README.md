# PoE2 Item Database MVP

_Warning: This is semi vibes and untested. Done in the background by claude 3.7 agent. Don't take it too seriously.
Lots of things are organized in absurd ways but for this solution it is enough._

_I just needed a simple way to search for items in PoE2 and this is the best solution I could come up with._

_Use dark reader or make a PR introducing dark mode :)_

A web-based item database for Path of Exile 2, featuring:
- Searchable item database
- Filtering by item class and attributes

# Buttonless version:

https://oasdflkjo.github.io/poeitems/?buttonless

# Standard version:

https://oasdflkjo.github.io/poeitems/

## Features

- Filter by item class (Armor, Weapons, Jewelry, etc.)
- Filter by attributes (Strength, Dexterity, Intelligence)
- View detailed item statistics
- Sort items by various properties

## Data Source

Item data is extracted from the [Path of Building - PoE2](https://github.com/PathOfBuildingCommunity/PathOfBuilding-PoE2) repository.

No automation is used yet but prolly worth hooking it upt to run each time a new version of PoE2 is released.
